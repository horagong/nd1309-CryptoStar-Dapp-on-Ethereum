# Project: Build CryptoStar Dapp on Ethereum

In this project I created a CryptoStar Dapp using ERC-721 Token.

* This token has the name of `Ohora Token` and the symbol is `OHR`.
* I developed it with `Truffle` v5.0.4 and `openzeppelin-solidity` v2.1.2
* “Token Address” on the Rinkeby Network is 0x5C1f909d1695b3B2F40a5727c5089700994a024C.
